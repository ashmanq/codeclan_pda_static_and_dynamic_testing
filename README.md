# Static and Dynamic Testing
The purpose of this app was to for me to demonstrate my ability to carry out static and dynamic testing. I had to carry out the
following:

## Task 1: Static Testing
Carry out static testing on testing_task_1.md.

* Comment any errors you can see.


## Task 2: Dynamic Testing
Carry out dynamic testing on card_game.rb.

* Create a spec file and write a test for each function. 
* Screenshot the test code and the tests failing Correct the errors you spotted in task A and screenshot the tests passing. 
* Save screenshots in the same folder as the code.
